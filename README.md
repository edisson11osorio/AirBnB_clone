## What’s a command interpreter?

Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object

## Resources
Read or watch:

* cmd module
* packages concept page
* uuid module
* datetime
* unittest module
* args/kwargs
* Python test cheatsheet

## Learning Objectives
* How to create a Python package
* How to create a command interpreter in Python using the cmd module
* What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
* How to serialize and deserialize a Class
* How to write and read a JSON file
* How to manage datetime
* What is an UUID
* What is *args and how to use it
* What is **kwargs and how to use it
* How to handle named arguments in a function

## Execution

The hbnb command interpreter should work like this in interactive mode:

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
```

But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C):

```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
```

All tests should also pass in non-interactive mode: ``` $ echo "python3 -m unittest discover tests" | bash ```
